# [RFC] Christopher Newport University Linux User Group Constitution

> This document was last ratified on [DATE].

The Christopher Newport University Linux User Group (CNULUG) is an online and
in-person community for people who use Linux or who are interested in learning
about it.

We are dedicated to promoting smart and socially aware computer usage.
Our core goals and values are:

- advocacy
- education
- support
- socializing

## [RFC] Mission

CNULUG exists as a general advocate of Linux and open-source software.
We have some important goals related to CNU, however:

- Improve on-campus knowledge and support for Linux and free/open source software (FOSS)
- Building a campus-wide culture around Linux and FOSS
- Help Linux and FOSS users access standard 
  university resources
- Educate users on modern uses of Linux, including security, web development 
  and computer engineering for ARM architectures
- Becoming a meaningful member of the global FOSS community

## [RFC] Membership

We welcome new users and do not charge dues or discriminate about level of
skill. Any Individual who falls under one or more of the following categories is
welcome to be a *Member* of our organization:

- Attended a meeting
- Subscribed to our mailing list
- Are active on our IRC channel (`#cnulug` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/))

An individual does not have to be an attending student or alumni of CNU in order to be considered a member of CNULUG.

An active member is any member who has taken part in a club meeting, posted on the mailing list, or joined our IRC room within the last month.

## [RFC] Rank-holding members

A *Rank-Holding Member* is any member who holds an official title within the
organization, besides that of just Member.

Official titles are created and based on different responsibilities that arise
in order to keep the club functioning under normal conditions.

Such new positions / titles are to be appproved by the president and at least
one more existing rank-holding member before it can be assumed.

## [RFC] Basic responsibilities

To ensure and maintain club organization, a list of basic responsibilities that must be met, either by any member or by specific individuals appointed by the president, is defined. Such responsibilities include but are not limited to the following

- Keeping mailing list running, irc channel running, website updated.
- Organizing events (includes scheduling rooms, etc), meeting and planning CNULUG meeting talks with professors, planning events on campus with other organizations/people
- Fundraising

These responsibilities must be carried out and may be assumed by any active member regardless of rank status.

Any officially recognized responsibilities are subject to approval from the president. 'Officially recognized' responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the ones aforementioned in this section, and expand to include any functions that are or become crucial towards keeping baisc club operations running.

Although not enforced, or assigned as duty to any member, taking notes of main points discussed at meetings to ensure everyone is kept informed of any events, announcements, and important discussions is highly encouraged by any member or group of members present during such discussions.

## [RFC] Elections

A general election by existing CNU-attending members and faculty associated with
the CNU Linux User Group is held at the end of every academic year to determine
new rank-holding members for the upcoming term. This election is to determine
the people who are to fulfill club officer roles for every **existing**
rank-held position, **excluding that of president**. No new positions are to be
determined by this election. In the event that a position is not voted on, there
is no person available or willing to assume the position, or a conflict is
discovered that prevents the elected person from assuming the role in any way,
the duties of such role will be assumed by the current president of the Linux
User Group until a second election for such role can be made. Secondary
elections happen at the beginning of the upcoming academic year to resolve any
previously found conflicts. Any new ranks / positions that have been previously
approved by the president and at least one other existing rank-holding member
will be determined by this election.

An election is won by a simple majority vote of at least half of the club
members plus one person.

A new president is only determined by the current member holding the title of
president. This is to ensure that only someone who has been determined to be
competent in areas essential / basic to club operations takes over such role.

## [RFC] Funding

A treasurer is to be apointed by the president should no previous member holding such rank exist, in the event that CNULUG receive any funding that requires the management of club monies. Should the position already be filled, a new treasurer is to be elected every year as per described in the **elections** section.

## [RFC] Amendments

The CNULUG Constitution is maintained through Git. Right now, the official copy is located at [https://github.com/cnulug/policies](https://github.com/cnulug/policies)

Pull Requests are our amendment process.
A Pull Request is either a Git-formatted patch on our mailing list or a "pull request", per GitHub's definition, to the https://github.com/cnulug/policies repository.

Prior to being merged into the official repository, the following is required of a Pull Request:

- A submission to either GitHub or the mailing list
- Discussion at a general club meeting
- An announcement on the mailing list, if the Pull Request was not originally submitted there

This is followed by a minimum week-long review and discussion period before changes may be merged into the official repository. The start of this one week period begins after all three requirements have been initiated.

## [RFC] Bylaws

Bylaws are documented in our [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cnulug/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md#citizen-code-of-conduct).
