# [RFC] Christopher Newport University Linux User Group Constitution

> This document was last ratified on April 4, 2019.

The Christopher Newport University Linux User Group (CNULUG) is an online and
in-person community for people who use Linux or who are interested in learning
about it.

We are dedicated to promoting smart and socially aware computer usage.
Our core goals and values are:

- advocacy
- education
- support
- socialization

## [RFC] Mission

CNULUG exists as a general advocate of Linux and open-source software.
We have some important goals related to CNU, however:

- Improve on-campus knowledge and support for Linux and free/open source software (FOSS)
- Building a campus-wide culture around Linux and FOSS
- Help Linux and FOSS users access standard 
  university resources
- Educate users on modern uses of Linux, including security, web development 
  and computer engineering for ARM architectures
- Becoming a meaningful member of the global FOSS community

## [RFC] Membership

We welcome new users and do not charge dues or discriminate about level of
skill. Any Individual who falls under one or more of the following categories is
welcome to be a *Member* of our organization:

- Attended a meeting
- Subscribed to our mailing list
- Are active on our IRC channel (`#cnulug` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/))

An individual does not have to be an attending student or alumni of CNU in order to be considered a member of CNULUG.

An active member is any member who has taken part in a club meeting, posted on the mailing list, or joined our IRC room within the last month.

### [RFC] Rank-holding members

A *Rank-Holding Member* is any member who holds an official title within the
organization, besides that of just Member.

#### New Positions
Official titles are created and based on different responsibilities that arise
in order to keep the club functioning under normal conditions. Such new 
positions / titles are to be appproved by the president and at least
one more existing rank-holding member before it can be assumed.

#### Dismissal of Duties
If a Rank-Holding Member is determined to be unfit to perform their duties effectively,
they may be removed from their position with a two-thirds vote by voting members. Upon
a successful dismissal vote, the Rank-Holding Member is immediately relieved of their
position and their duties are assumed by the other Rank-Holding Members. Upon being
dismissed, the formerly Rank-Holding Member becomes a normal member and cannot run
for re-election for a full calendar year.

Candidates to take over the recently vacated position must be nominated at this same meeting, and a
special election to fill any open position will take place at the following meeting. 
The rules for a special election are the same as the rules for a normal election.

To nominate a Rank-Holding Member for dismissal, any member may bring up an issue at
any meeting and the nomination must be confirmed by another member.

#### Resignation
A Rank-Holding Member may resign at any meeting. A special nomination and election will be held
the same as outlined above.

### [RFC] Elections

#### Schedule
A general election by existing CNU-attending members and faculty associated with
the CNU Linux User Group is held at the end of every academic year to determine
new rank-holding members for the upcoming term. This election is to determine
the people who are to fulfill club officer roles for every **existing**
rank-held position. No new positions are to be
determined by this election.

#### Eligibility
In order to be eligible to be a candidate, one must meet the following requirements:
- Attend a majority of meetings during the previous semester.
- Play an active role in club presentations or events.
- Run Linux on at least one device.

Candidates must be nominated during the meeting prior to the election meeting.
Candidates cannot nominate themselves, but must be nominated by another member
and the nomination must be confirmed by a third member. A nominee may refuse their
own nomination.

#### Unfilled Positions
In the event that a position is not voted on, there
is no person available or willing to assume the position, or a conflict is
discovered that prevents the elected person from assuming the role in any way,
the duties of such role will be assumed by the current president of the Linux
User Group until a second election for such role can be made. Secondary
elections happen at the beginning of the upcoming academic year to resolve any
previously found conflicts. Any new ranks / positions that have been previously
approved by the president and at least one other existing rank-holding member
will be determined by this election.


#### Determining a Winner
An election is won by a simple majority vote of at least half of the club
members plus one person. If no majority is reached, an immediate run-off
vote is held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes.
The winner of the run-off is the candidate with the majority of available votes.

If there is a tie in winning votes between two candidates for the same position, the tie
will be broken and winner determined by hot dog eating contest. Judges for
the contest are all current CNULUG officers present at the election meeting.

### [RFC] Funding

A treasurer is to be apointed by the president should no previous member holding such rank exist, in the event that CNULUG receive any funding that requires the management of club monies. Should the position already be filled, a new treasurer is to be elected every year as per described in the **elections** section.

### [RFC] Amendments

The CNULUG Constitution is maintained through Git. Right now, the official copy is located at [https://github.com/cnulug/policies](https://github.com/cnulug/policies)

Pull Requests are our amendment process.
A Pull Request is either a Git-formatted patch on our mailing list or a "pull request", per GitHub's definition, to the https://github.com/cnulug/policies repository.

Prior to being merged into the official repository, the following is required of a Pull Request:

- A submission to either GitHub or the mailing list
- Discussion at a general club meeting

This is followed by a minimum week-long review and discussion period before changes may be merged into the official repository. The start of this one week period begins after all three requirements have been initiated.

### [RFC] Meetings

#### Location
Meetings will be held on the Christopher Newport University campus in Luter room 221, unless specified otherwise by a rank holding member.

#### Time
Meetings will be held weekly on the same day and time each week. This time will be determined by a poll
sent to members via the mailing list each semester. Current Rank-Holding Members may decide which days and times are
available on the poll before normal members vote on it in order to ensure all Rank-Holding Members can
attend all meetings.

### [RFC] Bylaws

Bylaws are documented in our [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cnulug/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md#citizen-code-of-conduct).
